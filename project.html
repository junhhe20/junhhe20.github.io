The concept of Travel Meet stemmed from the unique memories of meeting people from various locations when traveling and creating brief relationships when abroad, whether it be with locals or sharing conversation with a couple staying in the same hotel. These relationships make each and every travel experience different from the next. During the peak of quarantine, the opportunity to experience these interactions drastically dwindled. Now, travel is slowly but surely resurfacing. Travel Meet will be able to utilize people's longing for personal interaction and travel to bring these experiences to the next level.
